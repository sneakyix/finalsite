            Google CEO Larry Page is selling Google Glass to anyone who can think
            of a unique use for the glasses and who can also afford the $1500 cost.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is unsure of what role marketers will play on Google Glass.
            Google mentioned that they do not intend on displaying digital ads
            on Google Glass. Also it was mentioned at a conference that Google held
            that Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Evernote, CNN and Elle are building apps.
            <br>
            <br>
            Google's long term plans for Glass and it's advertising strategy is unclear.
