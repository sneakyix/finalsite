            Google CEO Larry Page is selling Google Glass to anyone who can think
            of a unique use for the glasses and who can also afford the $1500 cost.
            <br>

            It is unsure of what role marketers will play on Google Glass.
            Google mentioned that they do not intend on displaying digital ads
            on Google Glass. Also it was mentioned at a conference that Google held
            that Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Evernote, CNN and Elle are building apps.
            Google's long term plans for Glass and it's advertising strategy is unclear.
            <br>
            <br>    
            Google has said that all glassware (software) on the device will be free.
            Google Glass initially has no locking system, meaning if the device was stolen
            everything on the device could still be accessed by anyone with no problem.
            So a technologist at Isobar developed an app called Bullet Proof that locks
            Google Glass as soon as the glasses are taken off.

            So far there is 10 000 pairs of Google Glasses out, and are owned by as
            Google calls them "Explorers" who own the Glasses but are basically just
            testing them out. As of now, Google does not have an official release date
            for Google Glass. Although they have not announced a release date, this 
            hasn't stopped people from dreaming about the great marketing abilities Glass 
            will have. For example travel and hospitality could benefit because Glass
            could easily direct users to landmarks and other tourist attractions.
